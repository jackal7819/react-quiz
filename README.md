# React Quiz 🎯

**React Quiz** — a simple quiz application built with React. It allows users to answer questions and get immediate feedback on their answers.

## 🧩 What is this project

This project is a basic quiz web-app. It demonstrates how to build interactive UI in React: rendering questions, handling user answers, tracking score, and showing results. It could be used as a learning project or as a foundation for a more complex quiz/training app.

## 🚀 Why this project exists

-   To practice building a small but complete frontend project using React (with TypeScript).
-   To explore component-based architecture, state and props management, and simple UI logic (question flow, user input, score calculation).
-   To serve as a demo project that can be shared with others (recruiters, other devs), showing React skills and clean project setup.

## 📦 Tech Stack / Dependencies

-   **React** — UI library
-   **TypeScript** — static typing (if used in your repo)
-   **Vite** (or other bundler) — build tool & development server (if you use Vite)
-   **CSS** — basic styling

> ⚠️ Adjust the list above depending on what you actually used: add libraries (e.g. state-management, UI, etc.) if applicable.

## 🔧 How to Install & Run

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jackal7819/react-quiz.git
cd react-quiz

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

# 3. Run in development mode
npm start
# or
yarn start

# 4. Build for production (if needed)
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

## 🖥️ Usage 

1. Open the app in your browser (http://localhost:3000 or port shown in console). 2. The quiz will start — user sees a question and multiple choices. 3. Select an answer and move to the next question. 4. At the end, get your result/score.

You can adapt the questions, add more features (timer, categories, score persistence, etc.), or reuse the core logic in your own projects.
